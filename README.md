# Customer Personality Analysis

Customer Personality Analysis is a data analysis project that focuses on understanding a company's ideal customers. By examining customer attributes and behaviors, this project aims to help businesses modify their products and marketing strategies to better target specific customer segments. Instead of spending resources on a broad approach, companies can leverage this analysis to focus on the most likely customer segments to increase sales and customer satisfaction.
